# STCE (Simple Text Communication Engine)

STCE is a project I'm undertaking to make a new type of social media engine that meets the following goals:

1. Keep it simple
2. Make the output easily machine-parsable so that APIs are unnecessary to create apps that interact with your site
3. Make it so that the output is easily stylable using a *single* CSS file and without changing any of the code outside of that file 
4. Make it easily deployable and configurable
5. Make plugins available to add optional features to one's STCE site

The result of this project should be an engine that deploys a social media website where users have their own "microblogs", similar to twitter.  These 'microblogs' should be able to use markdown styling in their posts (this particular goal may be implemented after the first alpha release), create new topics (not via hashtags, but create new "nodes" that users can view and post to, similar to "Subreddits" on reddit), interact with each other via post replies and tags, and post various types of content using links to other sites that are parsed by the optional plugins mentioned in goal #5 for display on the site.  

My concept of what STCE has been brewing in my head for quite a while now, so I felt it would help solidify these concepts and where they're going to create this repo and readme.  I am currently working on STCE and will post the first alpha here (and create packages for various distros) when it becomes usable and meets all 5 goals.  

## TODO:

1. Upload working version (Alpha-0.1)
2. Create distro packages
3. Get my own STCE site live on its own domain (name of site TBD), begin advertising service
